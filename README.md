## Overview
- Optimization Problem
  - Find best solution to a problem out of a large set of possible solutions.
  - It has two building blocks
    - `Objective`: quantity you want to optimize.
    - `Constraints`: restrictions on the set of possible solutions.
- Constraint Solver
  - 
- `Goolge Opeartional Research Tools`, used to solve optimization problems like below:
  - `Constraint Programming`: A techniques for finding feasible solutions to a problem expressed as constraints.
  - `Linear and Mixed-Integer Programming`: Find the optimal value of a linear objective function, given a set of linear inequalities as constraints.
  - `Vehicle Routing`:  Identifying best vehicle routes given constraints.
  - `Graph Algorithms`: Finding shortest paths in graphs, min-cost flows, max flows, and linear sum assignments.
- This librabry is written in `C++` and available to access via C++, Python, Java & .Net. In this tutorial we will focus on `Python`.
